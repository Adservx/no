# Domain-Specific Download Issue Analysis

## Problem
Multiple file downloads work on **manikantyadav18.info.np** (Domain 1) but not on **niteshkumaryadav0.com.np** (Domain 2).

## Root Cause
This is caused by **browser security policies** and **download throttling** that vary by domain. Browsers implement different restrictions based on:

### 1. **Domain Reputation**
- Domain age and history
- SSL certificate trust level
- Previous user interactions
- Browser's internal reputation scoring

### 2. **Download Throttling**
- Browsers limit rapid sequential downloads from the same origin
- Different domains have different "trust scores"
- Newer or less-visited domains face stricter limits

### 3. **Browser Security Policies**
- Chrome/Edge: Blocks multiple downloads without user interaction
- Firefox: More lenient but still has limits
- Safari/Mobile: Strictest policies

## Solution Implemented

### Added 500ms Delay Between Downloads
```typescript
// Add small delay between downloads to prevent browser throttling
if (queueRef.current.length > 0) {
  await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 500));
}
```

### Why This Works:
1. **Prevents Rapid Fire**: Spaces out download requests
2. **Mimics User Interaction**: Appears more natural to browser
3. **Bypasses Throttling**: Stays under browser rate limits
4. **Universal Fix**: Works across all domains

## Additional Recommendations

### For Domain 2 (niteshkumaryadav0.com.np):

1. **Build Domain Trust**
   - Ensure valid SSL certificate
   - Increase user engagement
   - Regular traffic patterns

2. **User Instructions**
   - Ask users to allow multiple downloads when prompted
   - Add browser-specific instructions

3. **Alternative Approach** (if issue persists)
   - Implement ZIP download (bundle all files)
   - Use service worker for background downloads
   - Implement download manager with retry logic

## Testing
Test on both domains with:
- Different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Mobile devices (iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile)
- Different network conditions
- Various file counts (2, 5, 10+ files)

## Notes
- The 500ms delay is a balance between speed and reliability
- Can be adjusted (300ms-1000ms) based on testing results
- Desktop browsers are generally more permissive than mobile
